                  <h3>My Mission</h3>
                  <p>My interest lies in the advancement in human knowledge through deep space innovation and research.
                     I'm very passionate about space exploration, and hope to one day aid mankind become a multi-planetary species.
                     I truly believe that space is a means for the world to come together and work out our differences to achieve something greater.
                     Overall, I enjoy being able to visualize and physically see what I am working on and as such have started to lean towards 
                     systems engineering to further expand my knowledge in space habitats.
                  </p>
                  <h3>My Story </h3>
                  <p>Since an early age, I have always been fond of puzzles. 
                    More specifically crossword, jigsaw, and hidden-object puzzles. 
                    As such I developed an analytical way of thinking and developed a talent for math and science which led to my interest in STEM. 
                    Coupled with the fact that it was at this early age that my exposure to science-fiction was at an all time high. 
                    Seeing the adventures and different environments on the big screen inspired me to make it into a reality. 
                    This is why I am learning French, Russian, and German. Not only for respect for those that have contributed to the aero industry but 
                    also because I want to be like them and contribute to my mission.
                  </p>
                  <h3>My Experiences</h3>
                  <p>
                    During my time at Texas A&M University, I have gone through many challenges that have molded me into the man I am today. 
                    I have served in the USMC Reserve as an Aviation Supply Specialist. I've interned at NASA JSC during my freshman year and have had the opportunity to work with 
                    many univeristy projects such as The 12th Astronaut for the NASA SUITS challenge and Space Habitat Design challenge at TAMU.
